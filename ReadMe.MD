### How to add own external search

<!-- TODO: write this after AnMaSearchTerms ReadMe -->
<!-- - Go to `UserData` folder (`Flow Launcher UserData Folder` in Flow Launcher)
- Go to `Settings\Plugins\ShikiFlow`
- Open `osettings.json`
  - If it does not exists, try adding some External Link or External Search using steps above
- -->

Edit `osettings.json`

Also, you can try [opening issue in mentioned repo](https://github.com/NoPlagiarism/AnMaSearchTerms), but I cannot guarantee adding anything
